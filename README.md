### 🚩 CO2 Emission Calculator ###

I've continued to work on a side project after graduating from General Assembly. This project is built wiht React and Dajngo. In this project, I've created an internal RESTful API and impemented two external APIs. 

CO2 Emission Calculator is a route planing app showing carbon footprint that different routes create. The app provide 3 different types of travel method, taking public transport, cycling, or driving. This app is aimed to encourage commuters to reduce their carbon footprint while traveling.
